swift (x.x.x)

  * Renamed swift-stats-populate to swift-dispersion-populate and
    swift-stats-report to swift-dispersion-report with extraneous unused
    options removed. The new tools use dispersion.conf instead of stats.conf.

  * Transaction id for each request is returned in a response header
    (X-Trans-ID). Setting the transaction id has moved from the proxy server to
    the catch_errors middleware. Additionally, the internal header has changed
    from X-CF-Trans-ID to X-Trans-ID.

  * Fixed Python 2.7 httplib compatibility problem.
